There is also an [example project](https://github.com/oakes/play-cljc-examples/tree/master/ui-gallery) showing how to use it in more detail.

If you're using the latest version of play-cljc, it brings this library in automatically.

* To develop the native version: `clj -A:dev`
  * On Mac OS, you will need to run `clj -A:dev -J-XstartOnFirstThread`
